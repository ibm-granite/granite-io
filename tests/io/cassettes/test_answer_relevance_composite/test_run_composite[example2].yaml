      a verbatim copy of the original response.  DO NOT attempt to correct any other
      perceived defects in the response. \nIf you agree with the assessment, provide
      an updated response that no longer fit the label No attempt, by providing a
      relevant response if an inquiry should be answered, or providing a short response
      if the last user utterance contains no inquiry.  Your response should be entirely
      based on the provided documents and should not rely on other prior knowledge.
