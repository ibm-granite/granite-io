        thing! I can demonstrate how we use templated responses here at the Granite
        AI system. This feature allows me to generate contextually relevant, coherent
        responses based on a given template and input text. Let's say you asked \\\"What
        would it be like if the capital of France were to suddenly transition its
        power from Parisian politicians to penguins?\\\"\\n\\nHere's an example of
        how I could use chat templating for this:\\n\\n**Template:**\\n\\n- Start
        with a brief introduction.\\n- Discuss the scenario as if it were happening
        in real life, including possible actions and challenges.\\n- End with an observation
        about the absurdity or unlikelihood of the situation.\\n\\n**Input Text:**
        \\\"Consider what would become of French politics if penguins took over...\\\"\\n\\n**Templated
        Response:**\\n\\n\\\"If penguins were to take over from Parisian politicians
        in our discussion, they'd need to adapt their style and habits to fit the
        demands of a bureaucratic role in France. Here's how it might play out:\\n\\n1.
        **Decision-Making:** In stark contrast to the eagle-like cacophony of Parisian
        Square Michel, our 'Polar Council' would meet under the icy blanket of the
        Eiffel Tower, using chalkboards (or possibly a freeze-proof LED flip chart)
        instead of paper and pens.\\n\\n2. **Debates:** The most vocal penguin representatives
        might do this not by calling out in unison as they're wont to do but through
        sophistically modulated icy peeps - likely using digital translation systems
        for the other species attending.\\n\\n3. **Voting and Laws:** To maintain
        consistency over freezing conditions, votes could be recorded through a touchscreen
        system embedded in their nests, while laws could be communicated silently
        to the ground staff who translate them into actionable directives on warmth
        control thermostats.\\n\\n**Finally, this hypothetical scenario is as fantastical
        as it gets. The very nature of their physical existence\u2014cold-bloodedness
        versus human blood flow\u2014predisposes penguins to inactivity and stasis
        rather than the energetic debates our current politicians engage in daily.
        Not only do they face a major challenge in generating enough heat for prolonged
        decision-making, but changing clothes amidst legislative hours would be impractical,
        as would keeping ice floes stocked around Capitol Paris.\\\"\\n\\nNow, feel
        free to ask another question or we can continue using this template for different
        scenarios if you choose!\",\"index\":0,\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":142,\"completion_tokens\":581,\"total_tokens\":723}}\n"
