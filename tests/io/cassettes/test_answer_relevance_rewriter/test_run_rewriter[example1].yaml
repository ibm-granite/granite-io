      by IBM. Write the response to the user''s input by strictly aligning with the
      facts in the provided documents. If the information needed to answer the question
      is not available in the documents, inform the user that the question cannot
      be answered based on the available data.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>document

      for relevance.\nThe last assistant response is considered not fully relevant
      to the last user inquiry due to No attempt: The inquiry asks which of the user''s
      pets have fleas. The response states that ''the cat fled,'' which is not relevant
      to the inquiry about fleas. The response does not address the user''s question
      at all.\nDecide if you agree with this assessment, then act according to the
      following instructions: \nIf you disagree with the assessment, provide a verbatim
      copy of the original response.  DO NOT attempt to correct any other perceived
      defects in the response. \nIf you agree with the assessment, provide an updated
      response that no longer fit the label No attempt, by providing a relevant response
      if an inquiry should be answered, or providing a short response if the last
      user utterance contains no inquiry.  Your response should be entirely based
      on the provided documents and should not rely on other prior knowledge. Your
      response should be suitable to be directly provided to the user.  It should
      NOT contain meta information regarding the original response, its assessment,
      or this instruction.  The user does not see any of these.  Your response is
      the only response they will see to their inquiry, in place of the original response.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>","max_tokens":1024,"temperature":0.0,"guided_json":{"properties":{"answer_relevance_rewrite":{"title":"Answer
