      Cutoff Date: April 2024.\nToday''s Date: April 1, 2025.\nYou are Granite, developed
      by IBM. Write the response to the user''s input by strictly aligning with the
      facts in the provided documents. If the information needed to answer the question
      is not available in the documents, inform the user that the question cannot

      the response for relevance.\nThe last assistant response is considered not fully
      relevant to the last user inquiry due to No attempt: The inquiry asks who attended
      the meeting. The response provides a vague and non-specific answer that does
      not address the question directly. It does not provide any specific information
      about the attendees.\nDecide if you agree with this assessment, then act according
      to the following instructions: \nIf you disagree with the assessment, provide
      a verbatim copy of the original response.  DO NOT attempt to correct any other
      perceived defects in the response. \nIf you agree with the assessment, provide
      an updated response that no longer fit the label No attempt, by providing a
      relevant response if an inquiry should be answered, or providing a short response
      if the last user utterance contains no inquiry.  Your response should be entirely
      based on the provided documents and should not rely on other prior knowledge.
      Your response should be suitable to be directly provided to the user.  It should
      NOT contain meta information regarding the original response, its assessment,
      or this instruction.  The user does not see any of these.  Your response is
      the only response they will see to their inquiry, in place of the original response.<|end_of_text|>\n<|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>","max_tokens":1024,"temperature":0.0,"guided_json":{"properties":{"answer_relevance_rewrite":{"title":"Answer
